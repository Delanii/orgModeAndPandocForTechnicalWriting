<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Technical writing is an art in its own. When writing a&nbsp;manual, technical writer has to be the&nbsp;middle ground between software developers and users. As a&nbsp;technical writer you have to bring the&nbsp;subject matter, the&nbsp;software you are writing about, closer to its users. Very often you will have to cooperate directly with software developers and using version control tools such as <code class="verbatim">git</code>  <a href="#cite-gitWeb"><cite>(Official Webpage)</cite></a>. I&nbsp;found it beneficial to use efficient tools that help you get the&nbsp;task done, and are also extensible to accommodate any need should arise from writing process.</p>
<p>That is why I&nbsp;have decided to make this basic blog, suitable for beginners trying to find good workflow setup for their writing.</p>
<h2 id="tools-i-recommend-and-rationale-why-to-use-them">Tools I&nbsp;recommend and rationale why to use them</h2>
<p>As noted above, I&nbsp;prefer to use tools that are extensible and allow a&nbsp;lot of options to meet any requirements that I&nbsp;may be facing during writing. The&nbsp;con is, as you might have guessed from the&nbsp;blog title, that these tools are often very complex. Also, I&nbsp;prefer to use open source tools whenever possible.</p>
<p>What does a&nbsp;technical writer need to do his job? For starters, it would be an <em>text editor</em>. That is a&nbsp;program that allows you to write text. Simple as that.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;would advise against writing in binary formats like <code class="verbatim">docx</code>  <a href="#cite-msword"><cite>(Official Webpage)</cite></a> and <code class="verbatim">odt</code>  <a href="#cite-libreOffice"><cite>(Official Webpage)</cite></a> (which are in fact archives of multiple files). The&nbsp;reason being is that it is actually more challenging to maintain consistent document structure and look with writing in those formats. From my experience, it is much more efficient to focus on content as a&nbsp;writer, and leave upholding the&nbsp;formatting and overall consistency on another application.</p>
<p>For choosing a&nbsp;text editor, well, the&nbsp;name of this blog is “{{{title}}},” and <code class="verbatim">org-mode</code>  <a href="#cite-orgModeOfficial"><cite>(Official Webpage)</cite></a> is a&nbsp;markup format native to program <code class="verbatim">GNU/Emacs</code>  <a href="#cite-gnuEmacs"><cite>(Official Webpage)</cite></a> (further referred to simply as <code class="verbatim">emacs</code>). Because <code class="verbatim">org-mode</code> is just a&nbsp;markup format, you can actually use any text editor to write text in <code class="verbatim">org-mode</code> markup. However, <code class="verbatim">emacs</code> has the&nbsp;best support for it. If you insist on using different text editor than <code class="verbatim">emacs</code>, some alternatives would be <code class="verbatim">vim</code>  <a href="#cite-vim"><cite>(Official Webpage)</cite></a> or <code class="verbatim">neovim</code>  <a href="#cite-neovim"><cite>(Official Webpage)</cite></a>, <code class="verbatim">atom</code>  <a href="#cite-atom"><cite>(Official Webpage)</cite></a> or <code class="verbatim">notepad++</code>  <a href="#cite-notepadpp"><cite>(Official Webpage)</cite></a>. In that case, you can skip chapters %%chapter references to chapters about%% <code class="verbatim">emacs</code> %%and%% <code class="verbatim">doom emacs</code> %%command shortcuts%%, which are focused on specifics of working with <code class="verbatim">emacs</code>. But for the&nbsp;full span of these blog posts, I&nbsp;will assume that you are using <code class="verbatim">emacs</code> as a&nbsp;text editor.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have chosen <code class="verbatim">org-mode</code> as format for technical writing because it allows great workflow management and is tightly integrated into <code class="verbatim">emacs</code>. But it is a&nbsp;markup format that is best used for documentation source, not its “presentation” form.</p>
<p>Nowadays most documentation has to be accessible from web, or must be compatible with web-based applications, which means we need our documentation in html format. Often is very handy having access to offline documentation, for which is best choice the&nbsp;pdf format. I&nbsp;personally have been facing requirements to provide documentation also in <code class="verbatim">.docx</code> or <code class="verbatim">.odt</code> formats.</p>

<h1 id="basics-of-version-control-with-git">Basics of Version Control with Git</h1>
<p>When you start a&nbsp;technical writing project, you can easily go by with an folder in your PC and thats it. But as the&nbsp;project grows, or you meet with more requirements from the&nbsp;client (maybe like to add another document format), you might wish to be able to test things out, or to comfortably revert from one state of things to another. That can be managed within folders, but sooner or later it will become clumsy and error prone. Other thing is, that client might straight from the&nbsp;beginning want you to contribute to some versioning system, to keep the&nbsp;manual in sync with current version of the&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>For those cases, you will have to use a&nbsp;version control system. Nowadays, the&nbsp;absolutely most used one is <code class="verbatim">git</code>. <code class="verbatim">git</code> is by definition “ distributed version control system (DVCS) ”  <a href="#cite-progit"><cite>Pro Git Book</cite></a>. How does it work? Software acting as version control is checking your files each time it is invoked, storing changes that have been made to those files in its own database. That way, you can revert to any previously recorded state of those files.</p>
<p>Now the&nbsp;“distributed” part means that the&nbsp;whole system does not have a&nbsp;central server (like it is with  centralized version control system (CVCS) ), but everything from the&nbsp;repository is mirrored to client local PC, even file history. This decentralized model brings more reliability, since if the&nbsp;server would went out of operation, the&nbsp;full repository can be revived from another clone. Also, these systems cope very well with multiple repository instances, so you can collaborate on your project easily with more people.</p>
<p>One of those  DVCS  is <code class="verbatim">git</code>. It is one of the&nbsp;most used  DVCS  today, maybe even THE most used  DVCS . Especially in open source development.</p>
<h2 id="sec:gitInANutshell"><code class="verbatim">git</code> in a&nbsp;nutshell</h2>
<p>Little contrary to previous description of the&nbsp;version control systems, <code class="verbatim">git</code> does not store changes to a&nbsp;file in time. Instead, <code class="verbatim">git</code> is taking snapshots of the&nbsp;whole repository filesystem in each commit. If there were no changes to an particular file compared to previous commit, <code class="verbatim">git</code> just stores reference to that file. <code class="verbatim">git</code> have uses hashes. Everything in <code class="verbatim">git</code> is checksummed with&nbsp;SHA-1 hash.&nbsp;SHA-1 hash is&nbsp;40 character string consisting of hexadecimal characters&nbsp;(0&nbsp;–&nbsp;9 and a&nbsp;– f) and calculated based on the&nbsp;file contents. All of <code class="verbatim">git</code> actions only add data. It takes an effort to make <code class="verbatim">git</code> erase any data.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p><code class="verbatim">git</code> recognizes three states of files: <em>modified</em>, <em>staged</em> and <em>committed</em>. <span id="target:gitFileStates"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>modified means that you have changed the&nbsp;file but have not committed it to your database yet.</li>
<li>staged means that you have marked a&nbsp;modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot</li>
<li>committed means that the&nbsp;data is safely stored in your local database</li>
</ul>
<p><code class="verbatim">git</code> representation of the&nbsp;project has three main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>working directory (project files currently on local PC)</li>
<li>staging area (file that stores information about staged files)</li>
<li><code class="verbatim">.git</code> directory (stores database of all the&nbsp;objects in your project)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="../pictures/git-basics_areas.png" title="git-basics_areas" alt="Main parts of git project repository, source: Pro Git Book,  " /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Main parts of <code class="verbatim">git</code> project repository, source: Pro Git Book,   <a href="#cite-progit">here</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Basic <code class="verbatim">git</code> workflow can be something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>You modify files in your working directory (working tree)</li>
<li>you selectively stage those changes that you want to be part of your next commit. Only those changes are added to the&nbsp;staging area</li>
<li>you commit those changes</li>
</ol>
<p>Committing clears the&nbsp;staging area and uses its content to create new snapshot of your working tree. This snapshot is stored in your <code class="verbatim">.git</code> directory.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-git">How to get <code class="verbatim">git</code></h2>
<p>For getting <code class="verbatim">git</code> on GNU/Linux I&nbsp;would recommend using your distribution package manager. The&nbsp;package will be most probably named “git,” so for example with <code class="verbatim">apt</code> package manager on Ubuntu or other debian based GNU/Linux distribution the&nbsp;command would be:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">sudo</span> apt-get install git</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The&nbsp;other installation option is compiling <code class="verbatim">git</code> from source code, but that could be for a&nbsp;little bit advanced users.</p>
<p>After the&nbsp;installation you can check whether <code class="verbatim">git</code> is working or not. As with most programs, you can use following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> <span class="at">--version</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you get <code class="verbatim">git</code> version info on the&nbsp;terminal without any error, you are good to go.</p>
<h2 id="basic-setup">Basic setup</h2>
<p><code class="verbatim">git</code> has its own tool for configuring. You can execute it with command <code class="verbatim">git config</code>. <code class="verbatim">git</code> configuration is divided in three layers: <em>system</em>, <em>global</em> and <em>local</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>system</em>: located in <code class="verbatim">/etc/gitconfig</code> file, requires admin rights to allow any modification. It is accessed via command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> config <span class="at">--system</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><em>global</em>: located in <code class="verbatim">~/.gitconfig</code> or in <code class="verbatim">~/.config/git/config</code> files is configuration for current user. It is accessed va command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> config <span class="at">--global</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><em>local</em>: located in <code class="verbatim">.git/config</code> file in project repository. It is accessed via command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> config <span class="at">--local</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
</ol>
<p>You can view your current settings with this command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> config <span class="at">--list</span> <span class="at">--show-origin</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or you can view value of specific configuration variable with command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> config <span class="op">&lt;</span>variable.name<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you didn’t set any <code class="verbatim">git</code> configuration variables before, it might return nothing. You can set <code class="verbatim">git</code> configuration variables with those commands:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> config <span class="at">--global</span> user.name <span class="st">&quot;John Doe&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>List of all <code class="verbatim">git</code> configuration variables can be accessed via <code class="verbatim">--help</code> flag:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> config <span class="at">--help</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="first-git-repository">First <code class="verbatim">git</code> repository</h2>
<p>You can get a&nbsp;<code class="verbatim">git</code> repository in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>clone</em> an already <em>existing</em> repository using its web url address, for example like so:</p>
<p>%%přidat git clone odkaz na repositář projektu%%</p>
<p>which is actually the&nbsp;repository of this blog and full book releases of this blog.</p></li>
<li><p>you can <em>create one</em> yourself on your local PC. To do that, go into your project folder and type command</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> init</span></code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<p>Using any of these options you get <code class="verbatim">.git</code> folder added to your project folder. This folder contains all of the&nbsp;<code class="verbatim">git</code> files necessary to maintain version control over your project. But only by initializing <code class="verbatim">git</code> repository doesn’t make anything tracked by <code class="verbatim">git</code>. There are more steps to achieve that.</p>
<p>First, you have to add files, that you want to have tracked, to the&nbsp;initialized repository. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> add <span class="pp">*</span>.org</span></code></pre></div>
<p>which adds to initialized <code class="verbatim">git</code> repository all <code class="verbatim">.org</code> files for version control. By issuing <code class="verbatim">git add</code> command, those files get only into staging area (as described in <a href="#sec:gitInANutshell">previous section</a>). After adding the&nbsp;files, you have to commit them:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> commit <span class="at">-m</span> <span class="st">&quot;Initial commit.&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That also means, that you can have in the&nbsp;project folder also files that are not tracked by <code class="verbatim">git</code>. <code class="verbatim">git</code> doesnt mind. Until you <em>add</em> them to <code class="verbatim">git</code> tracking that is.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-git-repository">Working with <code class="verbatim">git</code> repository</h2>
<p>Basic workflow with <code class="verbatim">git</code> could be described as follows:</p>
<p>As you work with your project files, you modify them. If you have added them to <code class="verbatim">git</code> tracking, <code class="verbatim">git</code> sees them as <em>modified</em>, because you changed them from last commit. When you want to make another “version,” or project snapshot, you can selectively add each modified file with <code class="verbatim">git add</code>, or you can use <code class="verbatim">--all</code> flag to add all modified files to <code class="verbatim">git</code> staging area. <code class="verbatim">git add</code> command is multipurpose command, so you will definitely use it a&nbsp;lot. Finally, you <em>commit</em> all the&nbsp;staged files to <code class="verbatim">git</code> with <code class="verbatim">git commit -m "Informative message."</code> to create new snapshot of files tracked by <code class="verbatim">git</code>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../pictures/git-basics_lifecycle.png" title="git-basics_areas" alt="git workflow and file status changes as you work with them, source: Pro Git Book,  " /><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><code class="verbatim">git</code> workflow and file status changes as you work with them, source: Pro Git Book,  <a href="#cite-progit">here</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="checking-file-status-in-git-repository">Checking file status in <code class="verbatim">git</code> repository</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;main command to find out status of all the&nbsp;files in your repository, that means whether they are <em>untracked</em>, <em>modified</em>, <em>staged</em>, or in-sync with git repository snapshot; as defined <a href="target:gitFileStates">above</a>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13" data-org-language="sh" data-exports="both"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> status</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Output message of this command should inform you which branch you are using, about its state compared to the&nbsp;<em>default branch</em> and about state of files in repository&nbsp;– whether there are any <em>staged</em>, or <em>modified</em> files that can be staged or <em>untracked</em> files that are not managed by <code class="verbatim">git</code>.</p>
<p>There is also short form of the&nbsp;<code class="verbatim">git</code> status report, that is invoked with command <code class="verbatim">git status --short</code> or <code class="verbatim">git status -s</code> that outputs abbreviated information about your <code class="verbatim">git</code> repository. In front of every file name is status identifier for staging area and current worktree. These identifiers have following meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="verbatim">??</code> : signals that file is not tracked by <code class="verbatim">git</code>, therefore its state is unknown to <code class="verbatim">git</code></li>
<li><code class="verbatim">A</code> : means tht file was added to the&nbsp;staging area</li>
<li><code class="verbatim">M</code> : file was modified</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, identifier <code class="verbatim">MM</code> means that file was modified, staged and then modified again before committing previous changes.</p>
<h2 id="adding-files-to-git-tracking">Adding files to <code class="verbatim">git</code> tracking</h2>
<p>In order to begin tracking new file you have to <em>add</em> it to <code class="verbatim">git</code> tracking list via <code class="verbatim">git add</code> command. For example, if you want t start tracking file <code class="verbatim">test.org</code>, you would issue following command in terminal:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14" data-org-language="sh" data-exports="both"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> add test.org</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you run <code class="verbatim">git status</code> command again in the&nbsp;repository, you get information about new file being added to <code class="verbatim">git</code> tracking in output, section “Changes to be committed.” If you specify directory name to <code class="verbatim">git add</code> command all the&nbsp;files in thee directory are added recursively to <code class="verbatim">git</code> tracking.</p>
<h2 id="staging-and-committing-modified-files-in-git">Staging and committing modified files in <code class="verbatim">git</code></h2>
<p>Modify a&nbsp;file that is already tracked by <code class="verbatim">git</code> and check output of <code class="verbatim">git status</code> command output:</p>
<p>%%Nejlepší by bylo zde dát příklad.%%</p>
<p><code class="verbatim">git</code> informs you that there is a&nbsp;modified file that is not staged for commit. Lets remedy that by putting it into staging area with command <code class="verbatim">git add</code>. As was stated already, <code class="verbatim">git add</code> command has multiple use cases. All of them lead to adding file in its current state to <code class="verbatim">git</code> staging area. If the&nbsp;file is <em>untracked</em>, after commit is part of next and following project snapshots, until removed. If <em>added</em> file is already <em>tracked</em>, <code class="verbatim">git</code> puts its contents again into staging area for next commit.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15" data-org-language="sh" data-exports="both"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> add test.org</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After adding file to the&nbsp;next future repository snapshot you have to create that snapshot with <code class="verbatim">git commit</code> command.</p>
<h2 id="setting-ignored-files-to-git">Setting ignored files to <code class="verbatim">git</code></h2>
<p>It might happen that you dont want to have some type of files tracked by <code class="verbatim">git</code>, for example some log files or files that are created during your build process and are not part of the&nbsp;final release. When we get to talking about  LaTeX , you will notice that  LaTeX  generates pretty big number of build files that are needed to create resulting pdf, but that are not needed for reading it. For this occasion there is <code class="verbatim">.gitignore</code> file.</p>

<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="#cb18-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">emacs</span> <span class="at">--batch</span> <span class="at">--eval</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;(require &#39;foo)&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This can be used to evaluate exporting function defined in <code class="verbatim">ox-latex.el</code> that governs export from <code class="verbatim">org-mode</code> to  LaTeX &nbsp;– <code class="verbatim">org-latex-export-to-latex</code>:</p>
<p>%%–upravit název org-mode souboru–%%</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb19-1"><a href="#cb19-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">emacs</span> test.org <span class="at">--batch</span> <span class="at">-f</span> org-latex-export-to-latex <span class="at">--kill</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>%%blíže vysvětlit <code class="verbatim">-f</code> a&nbsp;<code class="verbatim">--kill</code> flags%%</p>
<p>However, with Doom Emacs there is additional hoop to be overtaken, that is, Doom Emacs make it a&nbsp;little bit harder to run Emacs in batch mode, because in batch mode Doom Emacs doesnt load any user configuration. That means you have to load it manually:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">emacs</span> <span class="at">--batch</span> <span class="at">-l</span> ~/.doom.d/config.el <span class="at">-f</span> org-latex-export-to-latex <span class="at">--kill</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you try to do this with your current <code class="verbatim">~/.doom.d/config.el</code>, you probably end up with some kind of error about unknown function, in my case it was <code class="verbatim">after!</code> %%?macro?%%. I&nbsp;have found that the&nbsp;easiest option is actually to put this “batch mode configuration” into separate file. Lets name it <code class="verbatim">latexExportConfig.el</code> and put it to our other Doom Emacs configuration files into <code class="verbatim">~/.doom.d</code> folder.</p>
<p>Now we can simply load this file instead of our full Doom Emacs config:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb21-1"><a href="#cb21-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">emacs</span> <span class="at">--batch</span> <span class="at">-l</span> ~/.doom.d/latexExportConfig.el <span class="at">-f</span> org-latex-export-to-latex <span class="at">--kill</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and %%it <strong>should</strong> work (TM) :)%%</p>
